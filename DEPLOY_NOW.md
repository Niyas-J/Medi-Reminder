## 🔄 If Deployment Already Started

Check your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your **"Medi-Reminder"** or **"MediReminderApp"** project
3. Check deployment status
4. Click on the deployment to see logs

---

## ⚡ Quick Check

**Is it deployed?**

Try these URLs (replace with your actual Vercel URL):
- https://medi-reminder.vercel.app
- https://medi-reminder-xxxx.vercel.app
- https://medireminderapp.vercel.app

One of these might already be live!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel?

**Solution 1: Check Build Logs**
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Click on your project
- Click on the failed deployment
- Read the error message

**Solution 2: Manual Build Test**
```bash
cd C:\Users\anees\OneDrive\Desktop\MediReminderApp
npm install
npm run vercel-build
```

If this works locally, Vercel should work too.

**Solution 3: Simplified Deployment**

Try deploying without the build step first:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Project Settings → Build & Development Settings
3. Set:
   - Build Command: Leave empty
   - Output Directory: `./`
4. Redeploy
